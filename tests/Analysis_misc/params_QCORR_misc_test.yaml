# TYPE OF pyCONFORT JOBS
verbose : True

# (1) CONFORMERS AND COM FILES GENERATION
QCORR : gaussian

# --- (4) ANALYSIS OF QM OUTPUT FILES (REQUIRES QPREP): QCORR
# OPTIONS
dup : True # if dup = True, analysis will also separate duplicate LOG files
amplitude_ifreq : 0.2 # amplitude use to displace the imaginary frequencies to fix during analysis
# if sp = True, the program will generate new COM files (from normally terminated LOG files) with the options selected from the user
sp : gaussian # write single-point COM files after analysis (options in QPREP)
suffix_sp : SPC # adds a suffix at the end of the single-point COM filename (i.e. FILENAME_suffix.com). If suffix_sp = None, no suffixes are added
ifreq_cutoff : 25 # cut-off for imaginary freqs

max_cycle_opt : 500
