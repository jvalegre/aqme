# TYPE OF aqme JOBS
verbose : True

# (1) CONFORMERS AND COM FILES GENERATION
QCORR : gaussian

# --- (4) ANALYSIS OF QM OUTPUT FILES (REQUIRES QPREP): QCORR
# OPTIONS
dup : True # if dup = True, analysis will also separate duplicate LOG files
amplitude_ifreq : 0.2 # amplitude use to displace the imaginary frequencies to fix during analysis
# if sp = True, the program will generate new COM files (from normally terminated LOG files) with the options selected from the user
sp : gaussian # write single-point COM files after analysis (options in QPREP)
suffix : SPC # adds a suffix at the end of the single-point COM filename (i.e. FILENAME_suffix.com). If suffix = None, no suffixes are added
ifreq_cutoff : 25 # cut-off for imaginary freqs

max_cycle_opt : 500

## atoms included in gen/genecp and their level of theory (it admits .txt or .yaml files with the basis set information)

## dispersion correction
empirical_dispersion : GD3BJ # type of dispersion correction
## solvation model

solvent_name : 'Chloroform' # solvent used (i.e. chloroform, toluene, etc)

# (4) OPTIONS FOR COM FILE GENERATION (write_gauss : True)
# By default, you include optimization in the COM files.
# Optional:
frequencies : True # include frequency calculation
calcfc : True # include calcfc in the optimization

# OPTIONS FOR SINGLE-POINT COM FILES (ONLY IF sp : True IN QCORR)
# charge and multiplicity
charge_sp : 5 # charge of the single-point calculations. If charge_sp = None, the program takes the charge from the original LOG file
mult_sp : 3 # multiplicity of the single-point calculations. If mult_sp = None, the program takes the multiplicity from the original LOG file
# specify input line and final line (if qm_input_end_sp = None, no final line is added)
qm_input_sp : 'nmr = giao' # specify the input keywords (except functional, basis set, solvent and dispersion)
qm_input_end_sp : '-1' # last line to add for single point
