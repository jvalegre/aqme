   -  Added --sample to CSEARCH-CREST through RMS-based Butina sampling
   -  Changing to pip install by default in Read the Docs installation instructions

   -  Great acceleration of QDESCP using multithreading across molecules (instead of conformers)

      in the .xcontrol.sample file that weren't compatible with subprocess.run())
   -  Fixed bug when using squareplanar templates with ligands that bond with the metal centers 
      with the same type of atom (but they are different ligands)
   -  Added the 'Ir_squareplanar' geometry rule
   -  Better print for command lines (more reproducible commands)
   -  QDESCP adds an initial xTB optimization before the single-points (before, the descriptors

   -  Changed directory to create AQME-ROBERT databases to working dir (to adapt for full ML 
      workflows in ROBERT)

   -  Added geom and complex_type as options in CSV columns

      CSEARCH (xyz fixed in QPREP as well)

   -  QCORR is compatible with ORCA calcs (it doesn't detect spin contamination yet)
   -  QCORR includes hessian calculations for calcs with extra imaginary frequencies by default 
      (new option to control this: im_freq_input)
